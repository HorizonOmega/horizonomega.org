# Horizon Omega

*Facilitating AI safety R&D through collaboration and operational acceleration*

**HΩ** is a collaborative network aiming to reduce AI risk. We want to ensure the flourishing of sentient life. We aim to increase the rate of progress of AI safety R&D, through leveraging the skills and resources and initiatives of our members.

Our mission is to facilitate collaboration initiatives that advance AI safety and risk reduction. We provide a platform for project realization, hence supporting and enhancing the capabilities of members – researchers, operations, labs, other groups. Our open and adaptive approach allows to continously improve the network's positive impact.

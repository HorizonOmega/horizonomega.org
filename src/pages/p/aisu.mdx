# AI Safety Unconference

<p class="project-meta-header">Formerly VAISU · Hybrid edition planned for 2026</p>

The AI Safety Unconference (AISU) brings together researchers from leading organizations to share work, launch collaborations, and advance the field. Our unconference format puts participants in the driver's seat—sessions emerge from the community rather than being pre-planned.

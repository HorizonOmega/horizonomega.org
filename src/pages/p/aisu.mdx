# AI Safety Unconference

<p class="project-meta-header">Since 2018 · 400+ researchers · 60+ participants per event</p>

Participant-driven events featuring talks, sessions, moderated discussions, and 1:1s. We've organized AI Safety Unconference @ NeurIPS (2018–2022), Virtual AI Safety Unconference (2024), and a hybrid edition planned for 2026.

## About

The AI Safety Unconference brings together researchers from leading organizations to share work, launch collaborations, and advance the field. Our unconference format puts participants in the driver's seat—sessions emerge from the community rather than being pre-planned.

We've hosted researchers from Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI, Mila, MIRI, MIT, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, and many other institutions.

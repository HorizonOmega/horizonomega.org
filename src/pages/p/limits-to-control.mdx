## About the workshop

The Limits to Control Workshop convened researchers to map the boundaries of AI control, defined as the reliable capacity to constrain AI behavior to intended outcomes through technical and institutional measures. The program combined presentations, whiteboard discussions, and collaborative problem-solving to clarify viable research directions and impossibility results.
